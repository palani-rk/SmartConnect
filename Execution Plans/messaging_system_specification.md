## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Enhanced messages table
messages (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  channel_id: uuid REFERENCES channels(id),
  user_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  content: text,
  message_type: enum('text', 'image', 'audio', 'file'),
  metadata: jsonb, -- file URLs, dimensions, durations, etc.
  thread_id: uuid REFERENCES messages(id), -- for replies
  is_pinned: boolean DEFAULT false,
  is_edited: boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at: timestamptz,
  updated_at: timestamptz,
  deleted_at: timestamptz
);

-- Per-user message status tracking
message_user_status (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  message_id: uuid REFERENCES messages(id),
  user_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  status: enum('sent', 'delivered', 'read'),
  timestamp: timestamptz,
  UNIQUE(message_id, user_id)
);

-- Message reactions
message_reactions (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  message_id: uuid REFERENCES messages(id),
  user_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  emoji: text,
  created_at: timestamptz,
  UNIQUE(message_id, user_id, emoji)
);

-- Message mentions
message_mentions (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  message_id: uuid REFERENCES messages(id),
  mentioned_user_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  mention_type: enum('user', 'channel', 'everyone'),
  created_at: timestamptz
);

-- User presence tracking
user_presence (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  channel_id: uuid REFERENCES channels(id),
  status: enum('online', 'away', 'offline'),
  last_seen: timestamptz,
  is_typing: boolean DEFAULT false,
  typing_started_at: timestamptz,
  UNIQUE(user_id, channel_id)
);

-- Message edit history
message_edit_history (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  message_id: uuid REFERENCES messages(id),
  previous_content: text,
  edited_by: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  edited_at: timestamptz
);

-- Channel member permissions
channel_members (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  channel_id: uuid REFERENCES channels(id),
  user_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  role: enum('admin', 'member', 'readonly'),
  can_post: boolean DEFAULT true,
  can_upload_files: boolean DEFAULT true,
  can_mention_all: boolean DEFAULT false,
  joined_at: timestamptz,
  UNIQUE(channel_id, user_id)
);
```

### Real-time Architecture
- **Supabase Realtime** for live message updates
- **WebSocket connections** for typing indicators and presence
- **Optimistic updates** for immediate UI feedback
- **Message queuing** for reliable delivery
- **Conflict resolution** for concurrent edits

### File Storage Architecture
- **Supabase Storage** for file attachments
- **Image optimization** with multiple sizes (thumbnail, medium, full)
- **Audio compression** for voice messages
- **File type validation** and size limits
- **CDN delivery** for fast file access

## User Experience Flows

### Sending Messages
1. User types message in channel input
2. Message appears immediately (optimistic update)
3. Real-time broadcast to all channel members
4. Message status updates (sent → delivered → read)
5. File uploads show progress indicators

### Message Threading
1. User clicks "Reply" on existing message
2. Thread view opens with original message context
3. Replies are grouped under parent message
4. Thread participants receive notifications
5. Thread activity indicators on parent message

### File Sharing
1. User selects file via drag-drop or file picker
2. File validation (type, size, virus scan)
3. Upload progress indicator
4. File preview generation (images/audio)
5. File appears in message with download link

### User Presence
1. User joins channel → status becomes "online"
2. User starts typing → typing indicator appears
3. User idle for 5 minutes → status becomes "away"
4. User closes app → status becomes "offline"
5. Other users see real-time presence updates

## Message Format Specifications

### Text Messages
```typescript
interface TextMessage {
  type: 'text';
  content: string;
  formatting?: {
    bold: Array<{start: number, end: number}>;
    italic: Array<{start: number, end: number}>;
    code: Array<{start: number, end: number}>;
    mentions: Array<{start: number, end: number, userId: string}>;
  };
}
```

### Media Messages
```typescript
interface MediaMessage {
  type: 'image' | 'audio' | 'file';
  url: string;
  filename: string;
  size: number;
  mimeType: string;
  metadata: {
    width?: number;
    height?: number;
    duration?: number; // for audio
    thumbnail?: string;
    checksum: string;
  };
}
```

### Message Reactions
```typescript
interface MessageReaction {
  emoji: string;
  users: Array<{
    userId: string;
    username: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }>;
  count: number;
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Message encryption** at rest in database
- **File scanning** for malware before storage
- **Access controls** via Supabase RLS
- **Audit logging** for message edits and deletions

### User Permissions
- **Channel-level permissions** for posting and file sharing
- **Role-based access** (admin, member, readonly)
- **Organization-level controls** for channel creation
- **Rate limiting** to prevent spam

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- **Message pagination** (50 messages per load)
- **Virtual scrolling** for large message lists
- **Image optimization** and lazy loading
- **Database indexing** on channel_id, created_at, user_id

### Real-time Optimization
- **Connection pooling** for WebSocket management
- **Message batching** for high-frequency updates
- **Presence debouncing** (typing indicators)
- **Selective subscriptions** to reduce bandwidth

### File Handling
- **Progressive file uploads** with chunking
- **Client-side image compression** before upload
- **CDN caching** for frequently accessed files
- **Automatic cleanup** of temporary files

## Success Metrics
