# Channel Management Feature Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the channel management feature for the multi-tenant collaboration platform, enabling organization administrators to create, manage, and assign users to channels within their organization.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **As an org admin**, I want to create channels within my organization so that teams can have focused discussion spaces
2. **As an org admin**, I want to manage channel settings (name, description, privacy) so that I can control communication structure
3. **As an org admin**, I want to assign users to channels so that I can control who has access to what conversations
4. **As an org admin**, I want to remove users from channels so that I can manage access when roles change
5. **As an org admin**, I want to delete channels when they're no longer needed
6. **As an org user**, I want to see the channels I'm assigned to so I can participate in relevant discussions

### Secondary User Stories
1. **As an org admin**, I want to see channel usage statistics so I can understand engagement
2. **As an org admin**, I want to create private channels for sensitive discussions
3. **As an org user**, I want to be notified when I'm added to a new channel

## Data Models

### Channel Type Definition
```typescript
// Database types
export type Channel = Tables<'channels'>
export type ChannelInsert = TablesInsert<'channels'>
export type ChannelUpdate = TablesUpdate<'channels'>

// Extended types for UI
export interface ChannelWithMembers extends Channel {
  members: UserWithOrganization[]
  member_count: number
}

export interface ChannelMembership {
  id: string
  channel_id: string
  user_id: string
  role: 'admin' | 'member'
  joined_at: string
  created_at: string
}
```

### Expected Database Schema
```sql
-- Channels table
CREATE TABLE channels (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public' CHECK (type IN ('public', 'private')),
  created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(organization_id, name)
);

-- Channel memberships table
CREATE TABLE channel_memberships (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  channel_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES channels(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member' CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'member')),
  joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(channel_id, user_id)
);
```

## Validation Schemas

### Zod Validation Schemas
```typescript
export const channelCreateSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string()
    .min(1, 'Channel name is required')
    .min(2, 'Channel name must be at least 2 characters')
    .max(100, 'Channel name must be less than 100 characters')
    .regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-_#]+$/, 'Channel name can only contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, underscores, and #'),
  description: z.string()
    .max(500, 'Description must be less than 500 characters')
    .optional(),
  type: z.enum(['public', 'private'], {
    required_error: 'Channel type is required'
  }).default('public')
})

export const channelUpdateSchema = channelCreateSchema.partial()

export const channelMembershipSchema = z.object({
  user_ids: z.array(z.string().uuid('Invalid user ID')).min(1, 'At least one user must be selected'),
  role: z.enum(['admin', 'member']).default('member')
})
```

## API Endpoints & Service Layer

### Channel Service Functions
```typescript
class ChannelService {
  // Channel CRUD operations
  async getChannelsByOrganization(organizationId: string): Promise<Channel[]>
  async getChannelWithMembers(channelId: string): Promise<ChannelWithMembers>
  async createChannel(data: ChannelCreateForm, organizationId: string): Promise<Channel>
  async updateChannel(channelId: string, data: ChannelUpdateForm): Promise<Channel>
  async deleteChannel(channelId: string): Promise<void>
  
  // Membership management
  async addUsersToChannel(channelId: string, userIds: string[], role?: 'admin' | 'member'): Promise<ChannelMembership[]>
  async removeUserFromChannel(channelId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>
  async updateMemberRole(channelId: string, userId: string, role: 'admin' | 'member'): Promise<ChannelMembership>
  async getChannelMembers(channelId: string): Promise<UserWithOrganization[]>
  
  // User perspective
  async getUserChannels(userId: string, organizationId: string): Promise<Channel[]>
}
```

## State Management

### Channel Store (Zustand)
```typescript
interface ChannelStore {
  // State
  channels: Channel[]
  currentChannel: ChannelWithMembers | null
  loading: boolean
  error: string | null
  
  // Actions
  fetchChannels: (organizationId: string) => Promise<void>
  createChannel: (data: ChannelCreateForm, organizationId: string) => Promise<Channel>
  updateChannel: (channelId: string, data: ChannelUpdateForm) => Promise<Channel>
  deleteChannel: (channelId: string) => Promise<void>
  setCurrentChannel: (channel: ChannelWithMembers | null) => void
  
  // Membership actions
  addUsersToChannel: (channelId: string, userIds: string[]) => Promise<void>
  removeUserFromChannel: (channelId: string, userId: string) => Promise<void>
  
  // Utility actions
  clearError: () => void
  reset: () => void
}
```

## UI Components Architecture

### Component Structure

## Integration Points

### Organization Detail Page Integration
- Add "Channels" tab to existing organization detail page
- Channel management section for org admins
- Channel list for regular users
- Integrate with existing user management patterns

### Navigation Integration
- Add channels section to sidebar for org users
- Show assigned channels with unread indicators
- Quick channel switching functionality

## Permissions & Security

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Org Admin**: Full CRUD on channels within their organization
- **Org User**: View assigned channels, no management rights
- **God User**: Read-only access for platform monitoring

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
```sql
-- Channels: Users can only see channels in their organization
CREATE POLICY "Users can view organization channels" ON channels
  FOR SELECT USING (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Channel memberships: Users can only see memberships for channels they belong to
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their channel memberships" ON channel_memberships
  FOR SELECT USING (
    channel_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM channels WHERE organization_id IN (
        SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
      )
    )
  );
```

## User Experience Flow

### Channel Creation Flow
1. Org admin clicks "Create Channel" button
2. ChannelForm dialog opens with validation
3. Form submission creates channel via API
4. Success: Channel appears in list, dialog closes
5. Error: Show validation errors inline

### Member Management Flow
1. Admin clicks on channel to view details
2. ChannelMemberList displays current members
3. "Add Members" opens user selection dialog
4. Multi-select users not already in channel
5. Confirm addition, update member list
6. Remove members via individual action buttons

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Channel service functions with mocked Supabase
- Channel store actions and state updates
- Component rendering and user interactions
- Form validation scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Channel CRUD operations with local Supabase
- Membership management workflows
- Permission enforcement
- Real-time updates when channels change

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
- Duplicate channel names within organization
- Adding users already in channel
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Network connectivity issues
- Database constraint violations

### Error Display Strategy
- Form validation errors: Inline field errors
- API errors: Toast notifications
- Permission errors: Redirect to appropriate page
- Network errors: Retry mechanisms with user feedback

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Lazy load channel members on demand
- Implement virtual scrolling for large channel lists
- Cache channel data in store with TTL
- Debounce search functionality
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing

### Real-time Considerations
- Subscribe to channel changes for current organization
- Update channel list when channels are added/removed
- Real-time member list updates
- Handle concurrent modifications gracefully
