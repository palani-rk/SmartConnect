# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Tenant Collaboration Platform

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the requirements for a multi-tenant collaboration platform, similar to Slack, aimed at enabling real-time communication and collaboration for teams within organizations. The platform will support multiple organizations (tenants), each with isolated users, channels, and messaging capabilities. It will integrate with external platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram, ensuring a secure, scalable, and cost-efficient solution. The platform will also support multi-modal messaging, including text, audio, and images.

- **Concurrency**: Handles 5,000+ active users simultaneously.
- **Performance**: Low-latency real-time messaging.

### 5.3 Extensibility

- **Modular Design**: Easy addition of features (e.g., AI, mobile apps).
- **Custom Logic**: Serverless functions for flexibility.

### 5.4 Cost Efficiency

- **Tool Leverage**: Use existing libraries (e.g., Supabase) to reduce effort.

## 6. Scenarios

- **Organization Creation**: God User creates a new organization; Org Admin is assigned and invites users.
- **User Management**: Org Admin adds users, assigns them to channels, and links their WhatsApp/Instagram IDs.
- **Channel Interaction**: Org User joins a channel, sends messages, and receives real-time updates.
- **1:1 Messaging**: Org User initiates a private conversation with another user.
- **External Messaging**: Org User links WhatsApp, receives channel messages, and replies via WhatsApp.
- **Org Client User Interaction**: Org Client User is assigned to a channel, sends a multi-modal message (e.g., image) via WhatsApp, and receives responses.
- **Multi-Modal Messaging**: Org User sends an audio message in a channel, which is received by all channel members, including Org Client Users via WhatsApp/Instagram.
- **High Load**: Platform supports 1,000 organizations with 5,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Org User from one organization cannot access channels or messages from another organization.
