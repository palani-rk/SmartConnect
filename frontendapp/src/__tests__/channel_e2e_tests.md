# Channel Management E2E Tests

This document outlines the end-to-end test cases for the Channel Management feature.

## 1. Prerequisites

- The user must be logged into the application.
- The user should be on the `/channels` page.

## 2. Test Scenarios

### 2.1. View Channels

| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TC-VIEW-001 | Verify that a list of existing channels is displayed. | The page should render a list of channels, with each channel's name and description visible. |
| TC-VIEW-002 | Verify that a message is shown when no channels exist. | A message like "No channels found" or "Create your first channel" should be displayed. |
| TC-VIEW-003 | Verify channel list pagination. | If the number of channels exceeds the page limit, pagination controls should be visible and functional. |

### 2.2. Create Channel

| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TC-CREATE-001 | Verify that the "Create Channel" form opens. | Clicking the "Create Channel" button should open a modal or form with fields for channel name and description. |
| TC-CREATE-002 | Verify successful channel creation with valid data. | Submitting the form with a unique name and valid description should create the channel, add it to the list, and show a success message. |
| TC-CREATE-003 | Verify validation for a missing channel name. | Submitting the form with an empty name field should display a validation error like "Channel name is required." |
| TC-CREATE-004 | Verify validation for channel name length. | Submitting the form with a name shorter/longer than the allowed limits should display a validation error. |
| TC-CREATE-005 | Verify validation for a duplicate channel name. | Submitting the form with a name that already exists should display a validation error like "Channel name is already taken." |
| TC-CREATE-006 | Verify that the form closes on successful creation. | After successful channel creation, the form should automatically close. |
| TC-CREATE-007 | Verify that the form is cleared after creation. | After creating a channel, opening the form again should show empty fields. |
| TC-CREATE-008 | Verify that the form closes on cancellation. | Clicking the "Cancel" button or closing the modal should not create a channel and should hide the form. |

### 2.3. Edit Channel

| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TC-EDIT-001 | Verify that the "Edit Channel" form opens with pre-filled data. | Clicking the "Edit" button on a channel should open a form with the channel's existing name and description populated. |
| TC-EDIT-002 | Verify successful channel update with valid data. | Submitting the form with modified, valid data should update the channel in the list and show a success message. |
| TC-EDIT-003 | Verify validation for a cleared channel name. | Clearing the name field and submitting should display a validation error. |
| TC-EDIT-004 | Verify validation for a duplicate channel name on update. | Changing a channel's name to one that already belongs to another channel should display a validation error. |
| TC-EDIT-005 | Verify that the form closes on successful update. | After a successful update, the form should close. |
| TC-EDIT-006 | Verify that the form closes on cancellation. | Clicking "Cancel" in the edit form should discard changes and close the form. |

### 2.4. Delete Channel

| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TC-DELETE-001 | Verify that the delete confirmation dialog opens. | Clicking the "Delete" button on a channel should open a confirmation dialog. |
| TC-DELETE-002 | Verify that the channel is deleted upon confirmation. | Confirming the deletion should remove the channel from the list and show a success message. |
| TC-DELETE-003 | Verify that the channel is not deleted on cancellation. | Canceling the deletion should not remove the channel from the list. |
| TC-DELETE-004 | Verify that the confirmation dialog closes after deletion. | After a successful deletion, the confirmation dialog should close. |
| TC-DELETE-005 | Verify that the deleted channel is removed from the UI. | The channel that was deleted should no longer be present in the channel list. |

### 2.5. UI/UX

| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TC-UI-001 | Verify page responsiveness. | The Channels page and its components (forms, dialogs) should be responsive and usable on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). |
| TC-UI-002 | Verify loading states. | Loading indicators (e.g., spinners) should be displayed while fetching, creating, updating, or deleting channels. |
| TC-UI-003 | Verify error handling for API failures. | If a backend operation fails (e.g., network error, server error), a user-friendly error message (like a toast notification) should be displayed. |
